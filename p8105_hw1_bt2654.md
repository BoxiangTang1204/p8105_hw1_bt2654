## PROBLEM 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

**Description**

- The penguins dataset include totally 8 variables

- For the species variable it contains Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap, the
  counts for each values are 152, 68, 124

- For the island variable it contains Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream, the
  counts for each values are 168, 124, 52

- For the bill_length_mm variable, its range is \[32.1, 59.6\], the its
  mean value is 43.9219298

- For the bill_depth_mm variable, its range is \[13.1, 21.5\], the its
  mean value is 17.1511696

- For the flipper_length_mm variable, its range is \[172, 231\], the its
  mean value is 200.9152047

- For the body_mass_g variable, its range is \[2700, 6300\], the its
  mean value is 4201.754386

- For the sex variable it contains male, female, the counts for each
  values are 165, 168

- For the year variable it contains 2007, 2008, 2009, the counts for
  each values are 110, 114, 120

- Totally speaking, the penguins dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns

``` r
library(ggplot2)


scatterplot_1 <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
                       aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                           y = flipper_length_mm, 
                           color = species)) +
                       geom_point() +
                       labs(title = "Scatterplot of Flipper Length vs Bill Length by Species",
                            x = "Bill Length (mm)",
                            y = "Flipper Length (mm)")


scatterplot_1
```

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot_1.png", 
       plot = scatterplot_1, 
       width = 8, 
       height = 6, 
       dpi = 300)
```

## Problem 2

``` r
library(tidyverse)


set.seed(123456789)


norm_data = rnorm(10)


df_1 <- data.frame(
  norm_sample = norm_data, # a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
  gt_0 = norm_data > 0, # a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
  char_vec = sample(LETTERS, 
                    10, 
                    replace = TRUE), # a character vector of length 10
  fac_vec = factor(
    sample(c("low", "medium", "high"), 
           10, 
           replace = TRUE
           )
    ) # a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
)
```

``` r
mean(pull(df_1, norm_sample))
```

    ## [1] -0.09697437

``` r
mean(pull(df_1, gt_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(df_1, char_vec))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df_1, fac_vec))
```

    ## [1] NA

- Notice that for character vector and factor vector,we cannot calculate
  the mean of those two, but for normal samples and logical vectors
  (gt_0) we can calculate their means

``` r
# Before converting
df_1$gt_0
df_1$char_vec
df_1$fac_vec

# After converting
as.numeric(pull(df_1, gt_0))
as.numeric(pull(df_1, char_vec))
as.numeric(pull(df_1, fac_vec))
```

- Before the converting, the values of the logical vector are “TRUE” and
  “FALSE”, after converting by “as.numeric()”, its values change to
  numeric number 0 & 1, this is because the R processes the Boolean
  value as the numeric values 0 & 1 (TRUE as 1, FALSE as 0), hence we
  can directly calculate the mean value of the logical vector and can
  use as.numeric() directly to convert the Boolean values to numeric
  values.

- For the character vector, its initial values all change to NA, which
  indicates that as.numeric does not work for character variables
  (cannot convert them to numeric variables). This phenomenon indicates
  that unlike Boolean value, R cannot directly process character values
  as numeric values, hence we cannot directly apply the mean function on
  character variables. Also in R, we cannot directly convert character
  values into numeric values by using function “as.numeric()”, thus the
  only output we get after applying the function on character vector is
  NA.

- For the factor vector, after converting by “as.numeric()”, its
  original values - “low”, medium” and “high” are all change to numeric
  numbers 1, 2 and 3. It implies that although unlike Boolean values, R
  cannot directly process values (or levels) of factor vector as numeric
  values which means we cannot directly calculate the mean of factor
  vector by using mean function, R still can refers each value (or
  level) of factor vector to a specific numeric tags accordingly by
  using “as.numeric()” function.
